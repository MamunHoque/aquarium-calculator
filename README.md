# Aquarium Glass Calculator

This project is a simple **Aquarium Glass Calculator** that helps users calculate the glass dimensions for building aquariums based on user-provided dimensions. The calculator displays the appropriate glass sizes for each panel (Front, Back, Sides, and Bottom), along with a recommended glass thickness based on the aquarium's volume.
